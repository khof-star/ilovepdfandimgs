  <h1 class="fw-bold mb-4">Our Story</h1>
  <p class="fs-5 text-muted">
    The iLoveFiles journey began with a simple idea: make everyday file tasks fast, accessible, and completely free.
    As someone who struggled with online tools filled with ads, paywalls, and limits, I decided to build something better â€” for everyone.
  </p>

  <p class="fs-5 text-muted">
    This platform was built from scratch by <strong>a self-taught developer</strong> with a passion for technology and problem-solving.
    There were no teams, no funding â€” just determination and thousands of late-night hours. 
    Today, I'm proud to offer a set of tools that anyone, anywhere can use with ease.
  </p>

  <p class="fs-5 text-muted">
    All features here are <strong style="color: green;">100% FREE</strong> â€” no hidden costs, no sign-up traps.
    Whether youâ€™re merging PDFs, converting Word or PowerPoint files, or extracting images from documents, everything is made to be as fast and smooth as possible.
  </p>

  <p class="fs-5 text-muted">
    I believe that technology should empower people â€” not frustrate them.
    Thatâ€™s why this project will always stay free, privacy-respecting, and focused on simplicity.
  </p>

  <p class="fs-5 text-muted">
    If this platform has helped even one student, one teacher, one freelancer â€” itâ€™s all worth it.
    Thank you for using iLoveFiles. More tools and updates are coming soon ðŸš€
